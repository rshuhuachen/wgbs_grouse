# wgbs_grouse

This is the github repository where we analyse whole genome bisulphite sequencing data of a single black grouse (male) sample to characterise whole genome methylation patterns. This repository is linked to https://github.com/rshuhuachen/ms_epi_effort.

The bioinformatic pipeline was executed with snakemake and can be found in the workflow subdirectory. 
The sliding-window analysis and the plotting of the results can be found in the scripts subdirectory.
